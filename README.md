# Canine-Collective
Everyone loves animals. Not everyone loves the same kind of animal. Some love birds, some love snakes, some love cats, and others love dogs. We in the DogFathers love dogs. We have created a app to help each individual select the proper dog for their household. We don't just go off of breeds or cuteness. We have certain parameters such as grooming, energy level, and temperament to narrow the search down. Not only does the dog have to be compatible to the human but the human has to be compatible to the dog. The human has to get the right dog to not only play with but love, enjoy, nuture, take care of, and provide a proper home for.
This project solves two issues. The Dogfathers learned how to create a responsive app and humans find a furry friend.
This project is unique. It is unique because of all the necessary information that is provided. This app also helps you find the nearest adoptation agency to you.
